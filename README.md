React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update them when the data changes. React uses a virtual representation of the DOM and follows a component-based architecture, promoting code reusability and scalability. It is widely used for building interactive and responsive user interfaces in web and mobile applications.



react is a library

why do we say react is a javascript library?
what is we code inside the react is javascript



talking why do we use react 

if you create a page html css aand javascript
we link with seprate pages
we interlink the page it provide reaload
 whenever go to next page that we are making request server
 and this is solved by react in react js no reloading between



this not the major thing react is poplar beacuse it present component , reusable components
we want to html or webpag it has nav content footer
but the nav and footer naver changes only content change 


now we talk about component 
that means you need not to use the import the major thing into every page this is resolve by react.
you can make a separate component that is naav or footer byuse .jsx
suppose you create the two page one is home page and seconnd is contact page and you want to connect the naav componentto home page as well as the content page you can connnect as you connnect he css to the html file whereever you want
and it eaiser to manage if you want to update any file it willbe easier for you
so everting is inthe react is form of component 


you may hered about DOM (document aobject model API)
whic is present the javascript it nothing it the tree structure

if you inthe home page
in html have head and body thisis create the dom in body div in div has certain compent thatmeans it create model

with the help of JavaScript you can manuplate 


jsx = javascript xml


the versiontof javascript is es6
and react use es6 we import and export
 import veriable from "./file name"

in html  we import css by link




why we use anglar
angular is alternative to react
